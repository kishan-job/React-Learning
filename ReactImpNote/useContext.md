# useContext is a React hook that allows you to access data from a context object without having to pass props down manually through multiple levels of components. It's a powerful tool for managing global state or shared data within your application.

Clarifying the Context Object and Its Components
React.createContext() returns an object that essentially defines a new context. This object has two primary properties:

Provider: This is a React component that allows you to provide a value to components within its subtree. It's used to share data with components that are descendants of the Provider.
Consumer: This is a React component that allows you to consume the value provided by the Provider. It's traditionally used to access the context value, but it's less common now with the introduction of the useContext hook.
Important Note: The Provider and Consumer are not components in the traditional sense where they have their own render methods. They are more like functions or constructs provided by the context object to facilitate data sharing.

Key Points to Remember:
The context object itself doesn't hold the data, but it defines a mechanism for sharing data.
The Provider component actually holds the data and makes it available to its descendants.
The Consumer (or useContext hook) is used to access that data within those descendant components.
