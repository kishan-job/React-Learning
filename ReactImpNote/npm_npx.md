# create-react-app is a executable package 

# babel and webpack are part of react-scriptsls

In short, when you use npx create-react-app, Babel is installed as part of the project setup, along with other essential development tools. You don’t need to install or configure Babel and Webpack manually, as create-react-app handles this for you.

By using this it create install biuld dependencies like babel and webpack.
webpack is use to optimized js code create react and the fucntionality form the reference package and give the optimized code

# Webpack ultimately makes the functionality from external packages which we refer in react code available in your code base

Exactly! Webpack is a module bundler that takes all the dependencies (including external packages) used in your React code and bundles them together into one or more files. This makes it easier to manage and include external packages in your application. It handles the process of transforming, optimizing, and packaging your code and its dependencies so that they can be served efficiently to the browser.

npm (Node Package Manager):

Primarily used for installing and managing packages.   
Installs packages either globally or locally within a project.   
Manages dependencies listed in a project's package.json file.
Handles versioning and resolution of package dependencies.   

npx (Node Package Execute):

Used for running executable packages without installing them globally.   
Downloads the necessary package temporarily, executes it, and then removes it.   
Convenient for trying out packages or running one-off commands.   
Helps avoid cluttering your system with globally installed packages.  


Installing Dependencies:

After running npx create-react-app, the necessary dependencies, including Babel and Webpack, are installed automatically. You don’t need to run npm install separately for these packages because the create-react-app script handles this as part of its setup process.
Configuration:

create-react-app sets up the default configuration for Babel, Webpack, and other development tools. You don’t see the configuration files for Webpack or Babel directly, as create-react-app abstracts these away. However, the tools are installed and configured under the hood.


# React and React-DOM libraries are included in the production build as part of the bundled JavaScript files. 
what is the meaning of buldeld javascript files means in production code from react and react-dom are combined in the js code. in building env with the help of webpack this code is converted to optimized file. so here you mention we still use react react-dom in production


babel and webpack we are not part of the project just they used to run react code in build env.

# react react-dom are indeed part of code base but not directly

React and React DOM are indeed not directly part of your application's codebase in the same way that your custom components are. They are external libraries that you incorporate into your project.
